# This workflow will upload a Python Package using Twine when a release is created
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python#publishing-to-package-registries

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A guide on how to create the screts secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN and secrets.TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN
# here https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
# The main staeps are:
# * Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens and create a new API token. If you have the project on PyPI already, limit the token scope to just that project. You can call it something like GitHub Actions CI/CD — project-org/project-repo in order for it to be easily distinguishable in the token list. Don’t close the page just yet — you won’t see that token again.
# * In a separate browser tab or window, go to the Settings tab of your target repository and then click on Secrets in the left sidebar.
# * Create a new secret called PYPI_API_TOKEN and copy-paste the token from the first step.
# * Now, go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens and repeat the steps. Save that TestPyPI token on GitHub as TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN.
